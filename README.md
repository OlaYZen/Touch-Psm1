# What is Touch
Touch is an easy way to create files using Powershell, its originally from linux, unix, freebsd and osx.

#### example

```
Touch Demo.txt
```
That creates an empty file in your current location called Demo.txt. Match that up with [Nano](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=nano&s=0&d=1&o=true) or [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) for powershell and you have the ultimate tool.


## Why not just "$null > Demo.txt"
Well if you are researching Touch for Powershell, you are probably already familiar with Linux or similar products, and don't want to adapt to windows's bullshit. use this to boost the PowerShell Experience

## Installation

1. Download the Touch file by [Clicking Me](https://github.com/OlaYZen/Touch-Psm1/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Open Explorer and locate your Documents folder.
3. Paste the Touch folder inside of WindowsPowerShell > Modules

#### example

```
C:\Users\username\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Touch
```

4. Done, you may now restart powershell

## (Optional, for Powershell 7)
if you are a Powershell 7.0 User, do Both

1. Open Explorer and locate your Docuemtns folder.
2. Paste the Touch folder insode of PowerShell >  Modules

#### example
